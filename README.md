## Project Proposal

The motivation of this project is the underrepresentation of females within the American entertainment industry. Our goal is to find correlations between female presence in movies, TV shows, or on the crew and the gross profit, ratings, and overall success of the media. In order to accomplish our goal, we will create static and interactive visualizations that will translate dense amounts of information into a format that is easier to understand and consume. Visualizations are all in all, a better way of telling the story of females and their presence within the entertainment industry and we hope that people will become more aware of the disparities that may exist.
