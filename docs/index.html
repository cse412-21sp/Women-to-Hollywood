Our goal is to find correlations between female presence in movies, TV shows, or on the crew and the gross profit, ratings, and overall success of the media. In order to accomplish our goal, we will create static and interactive visualizations that will translate dense amounts of information into a format that is easier to understand and consume. Visualizations are all in all, a better way of telling the story of females and their presence within the entertainment industry and we hope that people will become more aware of the disparities that may exist.</p><br/></div></div></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div style="background-color:#B1C2D0" idyll="[object Object]"><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container"><h1 id="numbers-in-history">Numbers in History</h1><h2 id="do-female-directors-make-more-movies-over-time?">Do Female Directors Make More Movies Over Time?</h2><p>The earliest movie available in IMDb is “Miss Jerry” was directed by Alexander Black in 1894. This is a black-and-white silent pre-film “Picture Play”, accompanied by narration and music, making it the first example of a feature-length dramatic fiction on screen.  However, it is arguably considered “La Fée aux Choux” directed by French female director Alice Guy-Blaché is the world’s first  narrative movie, and the first movie directed by a woman. Unfortunately this movie is not collected in IMDb database and the first movie directed by women was twenty years later in 1915, according to IMDb.
 
The development of movies industry was slow until it came to the sound era. The number of movies increased a lot after 1920s. However, there was not much growth of the movies directed by female. For a longtime from 1920s to 1960s, there were only  under 10 movies published every year directed by women.
 
Starting from 1970s, with the growth of the entire movie industry, more and more movies are produced every year. The amount of movies directed by females has increased a lot since then, but it’s still much less than the number of male directed movies. Is this situation getting improved?</p></div></div><div style="width:100%;padding-left:15vw;padding-right:15vw" idyll="[object Object]"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/question2_16215645190700/Dashboard1?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" scrolling="no" style="border:none" width="1000" height="900"></iframe></div><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container">
According to the ”% of movies directed by females”, starting from 1980s, women directors have made more and more contributions to the movie industry. Not only the total number of movies directed by females increased a lot,  but also the ratio of these movies when comparing to men-directed-movies.</div></div><br/><br/></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div style="background-color:#AACAD2" idyll="[object Object]"><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container"><h1 id="women-can’t-direct-action?-gender-stereotypes-in-directing-and-movie-genres">Women can’t direct Action? Gender Stereotypes in Directing and Movie Genres</h1><p>Gender stereotypes exist everywhere, with no exception in the field of directing. For example, many people believe that women have better verbal abilities than men, whereas men are assumed to have better senses of action, adventure, and suspenseful movies. This stereotype may lower the chances of a female director getting a job in some programs. Guess which genre has the highest and lowest percentage of female directors? Interact with the visualization by selecting different genres and sees the answer.</p></div></div><div style="width:100%;padding-left:15vw;padding-right:15vw" idyll="[object Object]"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/movies_2_16223280340890/Dashboard42?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" scrolling="no" style="border:none" width="1000" height="900"></iframe></div><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container">
The result has no surprise. Drama, Comedy, and Family movies are the top3 genres directed by a female. While action, adventure, and horror movies have a relatively low number. Some specific genres, for example, sports and western movies, though the number of data not as much as others, we can hardly see any these movies directed by females.</div></div><br/><br/></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div style="background-color:#B2CFD6" idyll="[object Object]"><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container"><h1 id="do-movies-directed-by-females-get-higher-ratings?">Do Movies Directed by Females Get Higher Ratings?</h1><h2 id="how-do-the-ratings-change-over-time?">How Do the Ratings change over time?</h2><p>The below visualization shows the average rating of all the movies publish each year by female and male directors. Although the ratings for movies directed by both female and male directors dropped since the World War II, the overall vote of movies directed by females are getting higher than those directed by males over the years. This trend is supported by large amount of movies produced after 1980s</p></div></div><div style="width:100%;padding-left:15vw;padding-right:15vw" idyll="[object Object]"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/question2_16215645190700/Sheet4?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" scrolling="no" style="border:none" width="100%" height="500"></iframe></div><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container">The rating data for women-directed-movies before 1970s are sparse because of the limited number of movies.

It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man.
Using this measure, we hope to see whether Rotten Tomatoes audience and critic ratings are different for various movies that pass or fail this test.</p></div></div><div style="width:100%;padding-left:20vw;padding-right:20vw" idyll="[object Object]"><iframe class="frame" src="./static/html/plotly_graph.html" width="800" height="800"></iframe></div><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container">From the main scatter plot we cannot tell much as the two categories seem to be distributed pretty evenly throught the graph. When we look at the
variable marginal density plot for x (critics ratings) we see that both movies that have passed the test and failed the test have similar density curves. Looks like critics ratings
are not influcend by the presense of women in movies. When we look at the density plot for y (audience ratings) we can see that movies that passed the Bechdel Test tended to get a lot of
audience ratings around 0.6. This may be becuase the audience may have consisted of mainly women.</div></div><br/><br/></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div style="background-color:#B1C2D0" idyll="[object Object]"><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container"><h2 id="are-budget-and-box-office-earnings-connected-to-presence-of-females-in-the-cast?">Are budget and box office earnings connected to presence of females in the cast?</h2></div></div><div style="width:100%;padding-left:15vw;padding-right:15vw" idyll="[object Object]"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/FP1_16216436914500/Dashboard2?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" scrolling="no" style="border:none" width="1000" height="850"></iframe></div><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container"><p>
The above interactive plot includes data on the cast of the 50 top-grossing movies of 2016, compared to either production budget or domestic box office earnings on opening weekend. Movies can be highlighted on whether or not they pass some condition on casting and billing of female actors, in addition to the Bechdel test.</p><p>For movies that had the highest box office earnings on opening weekend (over $100M), the percentage of overall cast that was female was less than 35%. Judging by the titles of these movies, most of these high-earners with a smaller female cast were action/superhero and adventure movies. For films with an overall female cast of 45% or above, the production budget and box office openings appeared to be lower.
Movies with a female actor in the first billing spot tended to have a higher percentage of overall female cast. Unsurprisingly, films that passed the Bechdel test also tended to have a higher percentage of women in the overall cast.</p></div></div><br/><br/></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div style="background-color:#C1BFCC" idyll="[object Object]"><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container"><h2 id="how-does-the-female-to-male-ratio-of-the-crew-compare-with-the-success-of-the-movie?">How does the female to male ratio of the crew compare with the success of the movie?</h2><p>The visualization below investigates the ratings of movies versus the ratio of female:male cast and crew members in movies.

The data for the visualization was based off of the counts of guesses of a cast or crew member’s gender for different movies and it is important to note that the full cast and crew was not listed for the movies so the ratios may not be completely accurate.
Just from looking at the distributions of the ratings versus the ratio of females to males, there is no strong correlation that indicates a film will be more or less successful with the a higher presence of females. The
lack of a correlation may then serve to support the idea that having more female representation within the cast and crew will have no harm towards the production.</div></div><br/><br/></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div style="background-color:#AFAEB9" idyll="[object Object]"><br/><div class="text"><div class="idyll-text-container"><h1 id="female-directors-with-top-box-office">Female directors with top box office</h1><p>Despite all the disadvantages and obstacles female directors face in the industry, many still gain huge success.
