Our goal is to find correlations between female presence in movies, TV shows, or on the crew and the gross profit, ratings, and overall success of the media. In order to accomplish our goal, we will create static and interactive visualizations that will translate dense amounts of information into a format that is easier to understand and consume. Visualizations are all in all, a better way of telling the story of females and their presence within the entertainment industry and we hope that people will become more aware of the disparities that may exist.</p><h2 id="do-movies-that-pass-the-bechdel-test-receive-different-audience/critic-ratings-compared-to-movies-that-do-not-pass-the-test?">Do movies that pass the Bechdel Test receive different audience<!-- -->/critic ratings compared to movies that do not pass the test?</h2><img src="./static/images/bechdeltest.png" alt="example"/><p>The Bechdel Test is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man.
Using this measure, we hope to see whether Rotten Tomatoes audience and critic ratings are different for various movies that pass or fail this test.</p><p>From the main scatter plot we cannot tell much as the two categories seem to be distributed pretty evenly throught the graph. When we look at the
variable marginal density plot for x (critics ratings) we see that both movies that have passed the test and failed the test have similar density curves. Looks like critics ratings
are not influcend by the presense of women in movies. When we look at the density plot for y (audience ratings) we can see that movies that passed the Bechdel Test tended to get a lot of
audience ratings around 0.6. This may be becuase the audience may have consisted of mainly women.</p><h2 id="changes-over-time-in-movie-directed-by-women">Changes over time in movie directed by women</h2><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/movies_16215442104760/Dashboard3?:language=zh-Hant&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe><h2 id="do-female-directors-make-more-movies-over-time?">Do Female Directors Make More Movies Over Time?</h2><p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/question2_16215645190700/Dashboard1?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="800"></iframe>
With the growth of the movie industry, more and more movies are produced every year. The amount of movies directed by females has increased a lot, but itâ€™s still much less than the number of male directed movies. Is this situation getting improved?
Starting from 1980s, women directors have made more and more contributions to the movie industry. tbc....</p><h2 id="do-movies-directed-by-females-get-higher-ratings?">Do Movies Directed by Females Get Higher Ratings?</h2><h2 id="how-do-the-ratings-change-over-time?">How Do the Ratings change over time?</h2><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/question2_16215645190700/Sheet4?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe><p>Although the ratings for movies directed by both female and male directors dropped since the World War II, the overall vote of movies directed by females are getting higher than those directed by males over the years. This trend is supported by large amount of movies produced after 1980s.</p><h2 id="are-budget-and-box-office-earnings-connected-to-presence-of-females-in-the-cast?">Are budget and box office earnings connected to presence of females in the cast?</h2><p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/shared/2BT6QSXDR?:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
For movies that had the highest box office earnings on opening weekend (over $100M), the percentage of overall cast that was female was less than 35%.
Movies with a female actor in the first billing spot tended to have a higher percentage of overall female cast.</p></div></div></div></div>
